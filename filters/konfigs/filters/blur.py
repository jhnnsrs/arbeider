    In [image processing](/wiki/Image_processing "Image processing"), a **Gaussian blur** (also known as **Gaussian smoothing**) is the result of blurring an image by a [Gaussian function](/wiki/Gaussian_function "Gaussian function") (named after mathematician and scientist [Carl Friedrich Gauss](/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss")). It is a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce [image noise](/wiki/Image_noise "Image noise") and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the [image](/wiki/Image "Image") through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the [bokeh](/wiki/Bokeh "Bokeh") effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination. Gaussian smoothing is also used as a pre-processing stage in [computer vision](/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision") algorithms in order to enhance image structures at different scalesâ€”see [scale space representation](/wiki/Scale_space_representation "Scale space representation") and [scale space implementation](/wiki/Scale_space_implementation "Scale space implementation").
